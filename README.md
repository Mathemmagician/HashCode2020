# HashCode2020

My first coding team competition. Performed much better than expected with an overall score: 25k / 27k.

The only sad thing is that the idea of calculating new library efficiency by creating a set of all books came a little too late for me
so I had to choose cutoff value intuitively and didn't have time to fine-tune it.
